Hey, Bojack. I haven't heard from you in like three months.
Did I tell you I'm working on a blog?
**beep**

I don't know if you heard, but Mr. Peanutbutter is running for governor.
I really wish you were here for this.
**beep**

Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.
He's not with you, is he?beepThis is Diane, by the way. Nguyen. Obviously.
**beep**

It's funny, the last time I saw you, you told me that you needed me in your life.
And then you just disappeared.Anyway, things are even crazier around here lately.
**beep**

I'm sure you'd say something like, "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
**beep**

Then you would so be so overwhelmed by the unbearable ludicrousness of the situation that you would get in your car and drive to hawaii. Wherever you are, I hope you're happy. I really do, Bojack.

The mailbox is full. Goodbye.
